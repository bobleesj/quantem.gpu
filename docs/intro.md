# quantem.gpu

One scientific GPU contract for electron microscopy—from compressed detector
data to exact products—across NVIDIA CUDA, Apple MPS/Metal, native Swift,
WebGPU, and an explicit CPU reference.

```{admonition} Living pre-release draft
:class: important
This site documents an evolving `0.0.1` release-candidate series. Public APIs,
runtime coverage, and recommendations may change between candidates. Python
examples currently pin the exact TestPyPI candidate
`quantem.gpu==0.0.1rc6`; Swift consumers pin an exact verified Git revision.

The documentation is a draft, but retained performance and parity rows are not
draft estimates: each is a frozen historical measurement tied to its stated
date, source revision, device, data plan, cache state, and acceptance rule. A
newer candidate replaces the documented pin only after those gates are rerun.

## Implementation and benchmark overview

This landing page explains the package contract and routes developers to the
right implementation surface. Numerical results are maintained in two places
only:

- the [implementation dashboard](dashboard.md) is the friendly, module-first
  view of current support, representative timing, memory, and parity state; and
- [verified benchmark results](performance/results.md) is the authoritative
  row-level ledger with revision, fixture, cache state, load plan, distribution,
  memory observation, and numerical gate.

| If you are… | Start here |
|---|---|
| choosing a runtime or checking current support | [Implementation dashboard](dashboard.md) |
| comparing a measured configuration | [Verified benchmark results](performance/results.md) |
| adding or rerunning a benchmark | [Benchmark methodology](performance/methodology.md) and [continuous profiling](performance/continuous-profiling.md) |
| investigating an older or rejected experiment | [Optimization ledger](maintainer/backend-optimization-matrix.md) and [historical experiments](maintainer/history/index.md) |

```{admonition} One claim, one owner
:class: important
The landing page does not copy benchmark tables. Current overview values belong
on the dashboard; complete provenance belongs in the results ledger; superseded
or rejected experiments belong in the maintainer archive. A cached reopen is
not a first source load, and a cropped or explicitly binned result is never
reported as native resolution.
```

Detector binning is exact block summation, not interpolation or cropping. It
may run while chunks are decoded so the unbinned 4D volume is never
materialized unnecessarily. The metadata still reports the original detector
shape, selected bin, output shape, accumulation/output dtype, memory estimate,
and policy reason. See [Load, decode, and bin](kernels/load-decode-bin.md) for
the mathematical contract and [Benchmark methodology](performance/methodology.md)
for every timed stage.

## The shared coordinate contract

Every backend interprets 4D-STEM data as

$$
I[R_r,R_c,k_r,k_c],
\qquad (\text{row},\text{column})\equiv(r,c),
$$

where $\mathbf R=(R_r,R_c)$ is the real-space probe/scan coordinate and
$\mathbf k=(k_r,k_c)$ is the detector coordinate. A private device layout may
be flattened, transposed, tiled, packed, or detector-major, but the public
shape, masks, metadata, and results preserve this meaning.

Read [Data model and coordinates](kernels/data-model.md) before implementing a
new kernel.

## Find the operation you are implementing

| Operation | Meaning | Kernel page |
|---|---|---|
| Load/decode/bin | compressed source to typed resident counts | [Load, decode, and bin](kernels/load-decode-bin.md) |
| Virtual detector | BF/DF/ADF and mean-diffraction reductions | [BF, DF, and ADF](kernels/virtual-detectors.md) |
| Detector moments | CoM row, CoM column, DPC, and iDPC | [CoM, DPC, and iDPC](kernels/com-dpc-idpc.md) |
| Ptychography | SSB object, phase, loss, and aberrations | [Single-sideband ptychography](kernels/ssb.md) |
| Scan selection | explicit half-open real-space subsets | [Explicit scan regions](kernels/scan-regions.md) |
| Presentation math | ranges, histograms, colormaps, FFT views, movies | [Display and export kernels](kernels/display-export.md) |

Each page combines the scientific equations, exactness and provenance rules,
optimization model, backend source map, and parity gate. This keeps the math
beside the operation instead of separating it into a generic tutorial.

## Choose the runtime you are implementing

| Runtime | Start here | Primary implementation boundary |
|---|---|---|
| CUDA | [CUDA](platforms/cuda.md) | Python adapters, CuPy, CUDA C/RawKernel |
| Python MPS | [Python MPS](platforms/mps.md) | Python adapters, MLX/PyObjC, Metal kernels |
| Native Swift/Metal | [Native Swift and Metal](platforms/swift-metal.md) | SwiftPM products and bundled Metal resources |
| WebGPU | [WebGPU](platforms/webgpu.md) | TypeScript adapters and WGSL resources |
| CPU reference | [CPU reference](platforms/cpu-reference.md) | independent NumPy/reference implementation |

All runtimes implement the same operation contract. They do not expose
platform-specific scientific workflows.

To run the CUDA implementation as a service, use
[QuantEM.GPU Remote](remote/index.md). Remote access is deployment and
communication, not another kernel runtime.

## What belongs in this package

`quantem.gpu` owns reusable accelerated IO, math, kernels, result contracts,
resource estimation, and scientific provenance. A consuming application owns
presentation, user-visible resource-policy choices, scheduling, and lifecycle.
No application framework or view state is required to build or test this
package.

Read [Kernel architecture](concepts/kernel-architecture.md) for the source tree
and [Kernel development lifecycle](developer/kernel-lifecycle.md) before adding
an implementation.

## How to interpret performance evidence

The [implementation overview](dashboard.md) is the dense one-page view
of implementation coverage and headline measurements. The
[Benchmarks and parity](performance/index.md) section keeps the complete
current and historical evidence with source revision, hardware, data
shape/dtype, cache state, load plan, memory peak, parity artifact, and
benchmark definition.

A cached reopen is not a first source load. A cropped or binned fixture is not
full-resolution evidence. A compile test is not a hardware benchmark. Rejected
experiments remain recorded so kernel developers can avoid repeating known
regressions.

## Start coding

Install the runtime you need, run the smallest relevant parity test, then use
the physical target device for performance evidence:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
swift test
```

See [Install](install.md), [API contracts](api/index.md), and
[Contributing](developer/index.md).
